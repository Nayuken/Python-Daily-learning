# Python-Daily-learning
This is going to be my attempt at keeping an active track of all the knowledge that I'm able to apply to my studies in python

Short term goal:
1. Add something new everyday
2. revise what I already have done when I learn a more efficient way to tackle it.

Long-term goal:
1. Turn the learning that I'm doing here and to actual projects
